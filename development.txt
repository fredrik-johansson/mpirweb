<h3>Development ideas</h3>

<p>Our GitHub issue tracker: <a href="https://github.com/wbhart/mpir/issues">https://github.com/wbhart/mpir/issues</a></p>

<p>Here is a list of ideas for development projects
that would be highly valuable to a large number of users.
Some of these could
make good student projects (or in some cases, research projects).
</p>

<ul>
<li>Parallelise the FFT for large integer multiplication</li>
<li>Write a "small primes" DFT for large integer multiplication</li>
<li>New assembly language for modern x86_64 processors with AVX support</li>
<li>Implementation of the Bouvier-Zimmermann algorithm for division-free binary to decimal conversion</li>
</ul>
